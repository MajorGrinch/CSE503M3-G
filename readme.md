This is module 3 Group Work
We have use a famous front-end toolkit "Bootstrap" to bring a more beautiful UI of our website. We **assure** that the toolkit is only for the UI of our website and we know it won't count for the creative portion.It is just for the group work of Module 3 and we will use our knowledge to modify the front-end layout to make it more suitable for this work. We will use our brains to write the main part of this group work, as well as the creative portion.  
Here is the [link](https://getbootstrap.com) of that toolkit.
