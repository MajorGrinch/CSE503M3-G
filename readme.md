We have use a famous front-end toolkit "Bootstrap" to bring a more beautiful UI of our website. We **assure** that the toolkit is only for the UI of our website and we know it won't count for the creative portion.It is just for the group work of Module 3 and we will use our knowledge to design and write the front-end. We will use our brains to write this group work, as well as the creative portion.  
Here is the [link](https://getbootstrap.com) of that toolkit.

## Creative Portion
We did a lot of work in creative portion which is shown as follows:  
1. we implement that users can get a list of their own stories. With jQuery and ajax technology, we simply get all stories of a single user without refreshing the whole page.  
2. We implement the "Agree or Oppose" function where a user can agree with or oppose to the comments of stories and every user can either agree or oppose a specific comment for one time.  
3. We implement the "Reply and Show All Replies" function where a user can reply to a specific comment and can view all replies of that comment. The above two functions also use jQuery and ajax.By the way, if you want to test this two portions, the comments under the story "Comment Strings whose hash value starts with '0e'" may helpful.  
4. A author could delete comments of his stories.
